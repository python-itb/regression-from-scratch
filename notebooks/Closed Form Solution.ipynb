    "The great thing about this RSS function is that it always have a global minimum. This is confirmed by calculus by setting the derivation of the RSS function to zero and directly find the $b_0$ and $b_1$. However, this value could correspond either to global maximum or minimum, we don't know for sure. After we have computed the second derivative we would have confirmed that the RSS function is a convex function, which means that it must have a unique, global minimum. However, RSS is a special case where the partial derivation can be set to zero so we could obtain the 'correct' parameter. More often than not, we could not do this. So take this closed form solution with a little bit grain of salt"

And in this specific case, we want to minimize the difference the RSS. In other words, what we're looking for is the $b_0$ and $b_1$ that would minimize the RSS. Intuitively, we would always find the minimum of cost function, but it turns out that in some cases, i.e logistic regression we would find the maximum value of the cost function.
